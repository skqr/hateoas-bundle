[GOintegro](http://www.gointegro.com/en/) / HATEOAS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/skqr/hateoas-bundle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/skqr/hateoas-bundle)
===================================================
This is a library and Symfony 2 bundle that uses a Doctrine 2 entity map and a [RAML](http://raml.org/) API definition to conjure a [HATEOAS](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm) API, following the [JSON-API](http://jsonapi.org/) specification.

Here's some of what you get.

* Modeling, documenting, and creating are one step.
* Flat, referenced serialization.
  * Clear distinction between scalar fields and linked resources.
* Magic controllers.
  * Fetching resources, with support for:
    * Sparse fields;
    * Linked resource inclusion;
    * Standarized filtering and sorting;
    * Pagination;
    * Resource metadata, such as facets in a search.
  * Altering resources, with support for:
    * Processing multiple actions in one request;
    * Request validation using JSON schema;
    * Create, update, and delete out of the box;
    * Assing services to handle any of the above for specific resources.

Here's what you'll need.

* A Doctrine 2 entity map;
* A RAML API definition;
* At least one Symfony 2 security voter.

Try it out
==========

Check out [the example app project](https://github.com/skqr/hateoas-bundle-example), so you can feel the magic in your finger tips without much ado.

Installation
============

Step 1: Download the Bundle
---------------------------

Open a command console, enter your project directory and execute the
following command to download the latest stable version of this bundle:

```bash
$ composer require gointegro/hateoas-bundle
```

This command requires you to have Composer installed globally, as explained
in the [installation chapter](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
of the Composer documentation.

Step 2: Enable the Bundle
-------------------------

Then, enable the bundle by adding the following line in the `app/AppKernel.php`
file of your project:

```php
<?php
// app/AppKernel.php

// ...
class AppKernel extends Kernel
{
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = array(
            // ...

            new GoIntegro\Bundle\HateoasBundle\GoIntegroHateoasBundle(),
        );

        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
?>
```

Step 3: Add these parameters
----------------------------

```yaml
# app/config/parameters.yml

# HATEOAS API
api.base_url: "http://api.gointegro.com"
api.url_path: "/api/v2"
api.resource_class_path: "Rest2/Resource"
```

Step 4: Add these routes
------------------------

```yaml
# app/config/routing.yml

# Place it underneath it all - it contains a catch-all route.
go_integro_hateoas:
    resource: "@GoIntegroHateoasBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml"
    prefix: /api/v2
```

Usage
=====

Have your entity implement the resource interface.

```php
<?php
use GoIntegro\Bundle\HateoasBundle\JsonApi\ResourceEntityInterface

class User implements ResourceEntityInterface {}
?>
```

You can now create a HATEOAS resource for it and serialize it as JSON-API. And, if your controller extends the HATEOAS controller, you can even return a neat HTTP response with the JSON-API Content-Type.

```php
<?php
use GoIntegro\Bundle\HateoasBundle\Controller\Controller,
    Sensio\Bundle\FrameworkExtraBundle\Configuration\Route;

class UsersController extends Controller {
    /**
     * @Route("/users/{user}", name="api_get_user", methods="GET")
     * @return \GoIntegro\Bundle\HateoasBundle\Http\JsonResponse
     */
    public function getUserAction(User $user) {
      $resourceManager = $serviceContainer->get('hateoas.resource_manager');
      $resource = $resourceManager->createResourceFactory()
        ->setEntity($user)
        ->create();

      $json = $resourceManager->createSerializerFactory()
        ->setDocumentResources($resource)
        ->create()
        ->serialize();

      return $this->createETagResponse($json);
    }
?>
```

Seems like it could get awfully repetitive, doesn't it?

That's why you don't have to.

Just register your entity as a *magic service*.

```yaml
# app/config/config.yml

# The resource_type *must* match the calculated type - for now.
go_integro_hateoas:
  json_api:
    magic_services:
      - resource_type: users
        entity_class: GoIntegro\Bundle\ExampleBundle\Entity\User
        raml_doc: %kernel.root_dir%/../src/HateoasInc/Bundle/ExampleBundle/Resources/raml/users.raml
      - resource_type: posts
        entity_class: GoIntegro\Bundle\ExampleBundle\Entity\Post
        raml_doc: %kernel.root_dir%/../src/HateoasInc/Bundle/ExampleBundle/Resources/raml/posts.raml
      - resource_type: comments
        entity_class: GoIntegro\Bundle\ExampleBundle\Entity\Comment
        raml_doc: %kernel.root_dir%/../src/HateoasInc/Bundle/ExampleBundle/Resources/raml/comments.raml
  cache: ~
```

And you get the following for free.

```
GET /users
GET /users/1
GET /users/1,2,3
GET /users/1/name
GET /users/1/linked/posts
GET /posts/1/linked/author
GET /posts?author=1
GET /posts?author=1,2,3
GET /users?sort=name,-birth-date
GET /users?include=posts,posts.comments
GET /users?fields=name,email
GET /users?include=posts,posts.comments&fields[users]=name&fields[posts]=content
GET /users?page=1
GET /users?page=1&size=10
```

And any combination.

You also get these.

```
POST /users

PUT /users/1
PUT /users/1,2,3

DELETE /users/1
DELETE /users/1,2,3
```

Sweet, right?

API Definition
==============

But first - you need to define your API.

The HATEOAS bundle needs to know which magic actions you want enabled for your resources. That's why each of them has a `raml_doc` key in the `config.yml`.

```yaml
# app/config/config.yml
go_integro_hateoas:
  json_api:
    magic_services:
      - resource_type: users
        entity_class: GoIntegro\Bundle\ExampleBundle\Entity\User
        raml_doc: %kernel.root_dir%/../src/HateoasInc/Bundle/ExampleBundle/Resources/raml/users.raml
```

Check out the [RAML docs](http://raml.org/docs.html) in order to learn more about what your API could look like. Nevertheless, the bundle will only pay attention to the [JSON-API URLs](http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-structure-resource-urls).

JSON-SCHEMA
-----------
Support for creating, updating, and deleting resources according to JSON-API is in progress. Currently, creating, updating, and deleting one or many resources magically is supported, and the services that handle these operations can be overridden - but resources can't be related when creating or updating. Default validation is handled by [Symfony's Validator Component](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/validation.html), so you can configure basic validation right on your entities.

Resources
=========

But you need to have some control over what you expose, right? Got you covered.

You can optionally define a class like this for your entity, and optionally define any of the properties and methods you will see within.

```php
<?php
namespace GoIntegro\Bundle\ExampleBundle\Rest2\Resource;

// Symfony 2.
use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ContainerAwareInterface,
  Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ContainerAwareTrait;
// HATEOAS.
use GoIntegro\Bundle\HateoasBundle\JsonApi\EntityResource;

class UserResource extends EntityResource implements ContainerAwareInterface
{
    use ContainerAwareTrait;

    /**
     * @var array
     */
    public static $fieldWhitelist = ['name', 'surname', 'email'];
    /**
     * You wouldn't ever use both a blacklist and a whitelist.
     * @var array
     */
    public static $fieldBlacklist = ['password'];
    /**
     * @var array
     */
    public static $relationshipBlacklist = ['groups'];
    /**
     * These appear as top-level links but not in the resource object.
     * @var array
     */
    public static $linkOnlyRelationships = ['followers'];

    /**
     * By injecting a field we can have both the JSON-API reserved key "type" and our own "user-type" attribute in the resource object.
     * @return string
     * @see http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-structure-resource-object-attributes
     */
    public function injectUserType()
    {
        return $this->entity->getType();
    }

    /**
     * We can use services if we implement the ContainerAwareInterface.
     * @return string
     */
    public function injectSomethingExtraordinary()
    {
        return $this->container->get('mystery_machine')->amaze();
    }
}
?>
```

Check out the unit tests for more details.

Entities
========

This bundle is pretty entity-centric. The way your entities look and the relationships between them, as mapped in Doctrine 2, are essential to the intelligence this bundle employs in determining what your API should look like.

Security
--------

Access control is handled by [Symfony's Security Component](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/security/introduction.html), so either [security voters](http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/security/voters_data_permission.html) or [ACL](http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/security/acl.html) must be configured.

If you don't want security at all, just configure a single voter accepting anything that implements `GoIntegro\Bundle\HateoasBundle\JsonApi\ResourceEntityInterface`. Not the best advice ever, though.

There is an unresolved [issue related to access control and pagination](https://github.com/GoIntegro/hateoas-bundle/issues/10).

Validation
----------

Default validation is handled by [Symfony's Validator Component](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/validation.html), so you can configure basic validation right on your entities.

Transactions
------------

Creating, updating, or deleting multiple resources on a single request is supported by JSON-API - [but no partial updates are allowed](http://jsonapi.org/format/#crud).

We use [explicit transaction demarcation](http://doctrine-orm.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/transactions-and-concurrency.html#approach-2-explicitly) on the controller that handles creating, updating, and deleting resources *magically* so that this rule is enforced.

Creating, updating, and deleting
--------------------------------

As mentioned, services for creating, updating, and deleting resources are provided by default.

But what about your business logic? That wouldn't fly far.

You can register services that handle each of these operations for specific resources called *builders*, *mutators*, and *deleters* by tagging them.

```yaml
# src/Example/Bundle/AppBundle/Resources/config/services.yml

example.your_resource.builder:
    class: Example\Bundle\AppBundle\Entity\YourEntityBuilder
    scope: request # Soon to not be needed.
    public: false
    arguments:
      - @doctrine.orm.entity_manager
      - @validator
      - @security.context
    tags:
      -  { name: hateoas.entity.builder, resource_type: your_resource }
```

This builder class should implement a certain interface. Here are the available tags and interfaces.

Tag | Interface
--- | ---------
hateoas.entity.builder | `GoIntegro\Bundle\HateoasBundle\Entity\BuilderInterface`
hateoas.entity.mutator | `GoIntegro\Bundle\HateoasBundle\Entity\MutatorInterface`
hateoas.entity.deleter | `GoIntegro\Bundle\HateoasBundle\Entity\DeleterInterface`

Ghosts
======

I know what you're thinking - what if my resource does not have an entity? Am I left to fend for myself in the cold dark night?

Not a chance. Ghosts are there with you, in the dark. To help you out.

*Ghosts* are what you create ghost-resources from instead of persisted entities. They are created within a custom HATEOAS controller, and can be fed to the resource factory in lieu of an entity. They define their relationships rather than the ORM knowing about them beforehand.

What you use for an Id, and the extent to which you use them is entirely up to you.

```php
<?php

namespace GoIntegro\Bundle\SomeBundle\Rest2\Ghost;

// Entidades.
use GoIntegro\Bundle\SomeBundle\Entity\Star;
// JSON-API.
use GoIntegro\Bundle\HateoasBundle\JsonApi\GhostResourceEntity,
    GoIntegro\Bundle\HateoasBundle\Metadata\Resource\ResourceRelationship,
    GoIntegro\Bundle\HateoasBundle\Metadata\Resource\ResourceRelationships;
// Colecciones.
use Doctrine\Common\Collections\ArrayCollection;

class StarCluster implements GhostResourceEntity
{
    /**
     * @var string
     */
    private $id;
    /**
     * @var Star
     */
    private $brightestStar;
    /**
     * @var ArrayCollection
     */
    private $stars;

    /**
     * @param string $id
     */
    public function __construct($id)
    {
        $this->id = $id;
        $this->stars = new ArrayCollection;
    }

    /**
     * @return string
     */
    public function getId()
    {
        return $this->id;
    }

    /**
     * @param Star $star
     * @return self
     */
    public function setBrightestStar(Star $star)
    {
        $this->brightestStar = $star;

        return $this;
    }

    /**
     * @return Star
     */
    public function getBrightestStar()
    {
        return $this->brightestStar;
    }

    /**
     * @return ArrayCollection
     */
    public function getStars()
    {
        return $this->stars;
    }

    /**
     * @param \GoIntegro\Bundle\SomeBundle\Entity\Star $star
     * @return self
     */
    public function addStar(Star $star)
    {
        $this->stars[] = $star;

        return $this;
    }

    /**
     * @return ResourceRelationships
     */
    public static function getRelationships()
    {
        $relationships = new ResourceRelationships;
        $relationships->toMany['stars'] = new ResourceRelationship(
            'GoIntegro\Bundle\SomeBundle\Entity\Star',
            'stars', // resource type
            'stars', // resource sub-type
            'toMany', // relationship kind
            'stars', // relationship name
            'stars' // mapping field
        );
        $relationships->toOne['brightest-star'] = new ResourceRelationship(
            'GoIntegro\Bundle\SomeBundle\Entity\Star',
            'stars',
            'stars',
            'toOne',
            'brightest-star',
            'brightestStar'
        );

        return $relationships;
    }
}
?>
```

Testing
=======

The bundle comes with a comfy PHPUnit test case designed to make HATEOAS API functional tests.

A simple HTTP client makes the request and assertions are made using [JSON schemas](http://json-schema.org/).

```php
<?php
namespace GoIntegro\Entity\Suite;

// Testing.
use GoIntegro\Test\PHPUnit\ApiTestCase;
// Fixtures.
use GoIntegro\DataFixtures\ORM\Standard\SomeDataFixture;

class SomeResourceTest extends ApiTestCase
{
    const RESOURCE_PATH = '/api/v2/some-resource',
        RESOURCE_JSON_SCHEMA = '/schemas/some-resource.json';

    /**
     * Doctrine 2 data fixtures to load *before the test case*.
     * @return array <FixtureInterface>
     */
    protected static function getFixtures()
    {
        return array(new SomeDataFixture);
    }

    public function testGettingMany200()
    {
        /* Given... (Fixture) */
        $url = $this->getRootUrl() . self::RESOURCE_PATH;
        $client = $this->createHttpClient($url);
        /* When... (Action) */
        $transfer = $client->exec();
        /* Then... (Assertions) */
        $this->assertResponseOK($client);
        $this->assertJsonApiSchema($transfer);
        $schema = __DIR__ . self::RESOURCE_JSON_SCHEMA;
        $this->assertJsonSchema($schema, $transfer);
    }

    public function testGettingSortedBySomeCustomField400()
    {
        /* Given... (Fixture) */
        $url = $this->getRootUrl()
            . self::RESOURCE_PATH
            . '?sort=some-custom-field';
        $client = $this->createHttpClient($url);
        /* When... (Action) */
        $transfer = $client->exec();
        /* Then... (Assertions) */
        $this->assertResponseBadRequest($client);
    }
}
?>
```

Error handling
==============

JSON-API covers [how to inform about errors](http://jsonapi.org/format/#errors) as well.

Our implementation isn't trully as complete as could be, but you can tell Twig to use our ExceptionController instead of its own in order to have your errors serialized properly.

```yaml
# app/config/config.yml

twig:
  exception_controller: 'GoIntegro\Bundle\HateoasBundle\Controller\ExceptionController::showAction'
```

Fetching multiple URLs
======================

Here's something useful but not RESTful.

You can use the */multi* action to fetch several JSON-API URLs, and this won't even result in an additional HTTP request.

```
/multi?url[]=%2Fapi%2Fv1%2Fusers&url[]=%2Fapi%2Fv1%2Fposts
```

The URLs just need to be encoded, but you can use the full set of JSON-API functionality supported.

A *blender* service wil make sure to notify you if, by chance, the URLs provided are not mergeable.

Caching
=======

Yeah. These processes are not cheap.

You might want to hold on to that metadata you've mined or that resource you've serialized for a while.

Resource Metadata
-----------------

The resource metadata describes a resource type. It describes its name, fields, its relationships to other resources, and other such things.

It's akin to the Doctrine 2 entity mapping, `Doctrine\ORM\Mapping\ClassMetadata`.

We obtain this class by inspecting an entity's mapping and its class, using the ORM and reflection.

You can cache a resource type's metadata for as long as neither of these two things change.

Here's how. Add this parameter.

```yaml
# app/config/parameters.yml

parameters:
    hateoas.resource_cache.class: GoIntegro\Bundle\HateoasBundle\JsonApi\ArrayResourceCache
```

Cache type | Parameter value
---------- | ---------
Array (none) | `GoIntegro\Bundle\HateoasBundle\JsonApi\ArrayResourceCache`
Redis | `GoIntegro\Bundle\HateoasBundle\JsonApi\RedisResourceCache`
Memcached | `GoIntegro\Bundle\HateoasBundle\JsonApi\MemcachedResourceCache`

You can customize your Redis or Memcached configuration by using any of the following options. Below are the default values.

```yaml
# app/config/config.yml

go_integro_hateoas:
  cache: ~
    # resource:
    #   redis:
    #     parameters:
    #       scheme: tcp
    #       host: 127.0.0.1
    #       port: 6379
    #     options: []
    #   memcached: ~
    #     persistent_id: null
    #     servers:
    #       - host: 127.0.0.1
    #         port: 11211
```

HTTP Response
-------------

Fetch responses are all delivered with an [Etag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag).

The Etag is created from the full body of the response, so it accurately represents the JSON-API document you're fetching, along with its includes, sparse fields, meta, etc.

Etags on requests are checked [using Symfony](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/http_cache.html#validation-with-the-etag-header).

Feedback
========

Feel free to **open an issue** if you have valuable (or otherwise) feedback. Hoping to hear from you (either way).
